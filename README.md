Peer to Peer Access Check

While working on the latest Player's Bay peer to peer system you've been assign to develop an algorithm that checks whether two peers can talk with each other.
Requirements

    Each peer can be connected to n other peers, n < 1024.
    Peer status can be either online or offline. If the peer is online he can forward the message to any of other peers that he's aware of. You can assume that this information is already available as an input to your API and that it will not change during the execution of your algorithm.
    It's up to you to design the function(s) that will make the API and define the data structures used.
    You should validate the correctness of the algorithm by developing a suite of unit tests covering API functionality for all of the use cases.
